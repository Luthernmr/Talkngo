# 🛫 Talkngo

[Talkngo](http://talkngo.darius-yvens.com/) is a site that allows you to find a travel partner in the country you want.

On this project, I realized the structure of the database, the creation and the management of the entities, the management of the controllers (linked to the publications of posts, the management of the profiles and the addition of the countries).


## 🛠️ On this project I learned to use :

- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [symfony](https://symfony.com/)
- [php](https://php.org/)
- [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/)
